<center><h1>What is a Full Stack Developer?</h1></center>
<font size="4px" face="cursive">
A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is known as a full-stack developer. <br> 
They have experience dealing with a variety of web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS,JavaScript, databases, <br>
servers, APIs, and frameworks,among others. <br><br>
Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. The front-end and back-end of the <br>
application would be built by a full-stack developer focusing on this project. <br><br>
In order to generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end <br>
using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, they would leverage front-end frameworks like React or Angular <br>
to speed up the development process. <br><br>
In order to manage the data and process requests, the developer would write the server-side code using tools like Node.js and <br>
PHP.To store user data and other data, they would also employ databases like MySQL or MongoDB. <br><br>
The integration of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for functions like authentication, messaging, and notifications <br>
would also fall within the purview of a complete stack developer. <br><br>
The full-stack developer may make sure that all parts are flawlessly linked and work together as an integrated unit by working <br>
on both the front-end and back-end of the social media platform. Because of the wide breadth of technical knowledge and <br>
problem-solving skills required, full-stack developers are in high demand in the software development sector.
