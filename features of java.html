<center><h1>Features of Java Explained</h1></center>
<font size="4px" face="cursive">The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years. <br>
Its popularity can be attributed to, among other things, its portability, security, and scalability.<br>
Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on several systems is one of the main factors <br>
in its appeal. Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust type system and allows <br>
automatic memory management. It is a powerful language for creating complex programmes thanks to its <br>
built-in support for multithreading and security features. In addition, Java features a simple syntax <br>
and a comprehensive API, making it simple to learn and use. <br><br>
Java is being used by more than 9 million developers around the world. It continues to be a widely used <br>
language in the software development industry thanks to its popularity and adaptability, which have made <br>
it a favourite among entrepreneurs and developers alike. <br><br>
Java includes a huge selection of libraries and frameworks that make it simpler for programmers to <br> 
create sophisticated applications.There are many useful classes and functions in Java’s standard library, <br>
and additional libraries and frameworks streamline the development process while adding even more
capability.</font>
<h2>Advantages of using Java</h2>
<font size="4px" face="cursive">The use of Java as a programming language has a number of benefits. 
Some of the main benefits are as follows:</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive">1. Java is a straightforward programming language since it is simple 
to learn and comprehend. <br>
2. Java uses implicit pointers, making it a secure programming language. <br>
3. Java code does not need to be constantly compiled in order to execute on a variety of systems. <br>
4. Java has strong memory management, making it a robust programming language.</font>
<h2>Features of Java</h2>
<font size="4px" face="cursive">A list of the most important features of the Java language is given 
below:</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive"> <b>1.Platform independent:</b></font> &nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Java is a “write once, run anywhere” language, meaning that Java 
code can run without <br> any changes on any platform that supports Java.</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive"> <b>2.Object-oriented language: </b></font> &nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Java is an object-oriented language that enables programmers to create modular,<br> 
reusable code components known as objects, making it simpler to develop and maintain complex programmes.</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive"> <b>3.Automatic memory management: </b></font> &nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Java includes an automatic memory management mechanism that relieves developers<br> of the 
need to manually handle memory allocation and deallocation.</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive"> <b>4.Security:</b></font> &nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Java contains built-in security measures that can block unauthorised access and shield users from<br> 
potential security risks. Java was created with security in mind.</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive"> <b>5.Rich API:</b></font> &nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">The Java standard library has a sizable number of classes and methods, giving programmers a<br>
wide range of practical tools for creating applications.</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive"> <b>6.Multi-threading support:</b></font>&nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Support for multithreading is integrated into Java, enabling programmers to create concurrent 
<br>aplications that can handle running several threads at once.</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive"> <b>7.High performance:</b></font>&nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Java is renowned for having a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which optimises code execution<br>
while it is running.</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive"> <b>8.Scalability:</b></font>&nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Java’s modular architecture and object-oriented programming make it simpler to create large-scale 
 <br>programmes that can be scaled up or down based on demand.</font><br><br>
 <font size="4px" face="cursive"> <b>9.Simplified syntax:</b></font>&nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Java has a syntax that is simpler than other programming languages, making it simpler for<br>
developers to write and read code.</font><br><br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
