<center><h1>Why and How to learn Python Programming Language?</h1></center>
<font size="4px" face="cursive">
Python is the programming language behind giant applications like YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, Uber, Netflix, and many more apps. <br>
But are you still wondering whether or not you should learn it? Should you add it to your knowledge stack? <br><br>
Direct answer- Yes! Learning it will assure you a great job, a high package, brilliant opportunities, amazing communities, <br>
and a successful and fulfilling software development career.Python is a general-purpose, interpreted high-level software <br>
development language developed in 1991, yet recently gained popularity with the 3rd version of Python ( Python 3). <br>
Let’s look at the reasons for the language’s popularity and how you can learn Python in the most engaging and practical way.
</font><br>
<h1>Why was Python developed?</h1>
<font size="4px" face="cursive">
Guido van Rossum, a software developer, got frustrated with the complex and tedious languages he was working with. <br> 
Hence in the 1980s, he picked the project of developing a syntactically beautiful, simple, easy, and fun-to-use language. <br> 
Fun! The name suggests that already. But to understand what made Python one of the most loved programming languages continue <br>
reading below. 
</font><br><br>
<h1>Features of Python Language</h1>
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Here are the 5 major reasons that make the Python language so popular with a fan base 
calling themselves “Pythonistas”.</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive"><b>1.Python is beginner-friendly:</b></font>&nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Python features very closely with the English syntax and is super easy to read even by someone,<br> 
not a coder. It uses fewer lines of code and simple rules with no semicolon at the end of every line or confusing brackets. 
</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive"><b>2. Python is Easy to Learn:</b></font>&nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Python’s rules and syntax are very easy compared to other popular languages like C, C++, and Java. <br>
Another thing that makes Python simple is that it is an interpreted language. Interpreted language means when you write a program <br>
in C or C++, you write the complete code and then check for errors in the compiler. But with Python, you can check if your code is <br>
error-free in every line and correct if it’s wrong.
</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive"><b>3. Python is highly versatile:</b></font>&nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Python can be used for small projects, say making a calculator, and for big and complex tasks such as <br>
web development, data analytics, etc. This is possible due to the pre-written codes you can use directly and build upon. These <br>
pre-written codes are called Python libraries and frameworks.Once you learn the basics of Python through self-study, a degree, <br>
or a course, you’ll be able to understand a huge amount of code developed by other programmers.
</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive"><b>4. Python is super flexible:</b></font>&nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Python offers flexibility with the platform it is used upon. You can easily run the Python <br> 
code you wrote on Windows over Linux or macOS without making any changes. Another exciting feature of Python is that it can <br>
run along with other programming languages such as Java (Jython) or C Language (CPython). 
</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive"><b>5. Free and Open-Source:</b></font>&nbsp;
<font size="4px" face="cursive">Python is completely free to use, even for commercial purposes. It doesn’t cost anything to <br>
download Python or to include it in your application. It can also be freely modified and re-distributed. You can download <br>
Python from the official Python website.
</font>
<h1>Applications of Python Language</h1>
<font size="4px" face="cursive">With incredible versatility, Python has a wide range of applications. Some major fields where Python <br>
language is used are-</font><br><br>
<font size="4px" face="cursive">
   1. Web development (Backend) <br>
   2. Software development <br>
   3. Data Analytics <br>
   4. Machine Learning <br>
   5. Artificial Intelligence <br>
   6. Mathematical Analysis <br>
   7. System Scripting and <br>
   8. Cyber Security <br>
</font>
<h1>Why learn Python Language?</h1>
<font size="4px" face="cursive">With an ever-growing community of Python users and its versatility and wide applications,it has become <br>
the most popular programming language (leaving behind Java and C++). It has got abundant libraries, various <br>
frameworks, modules and file extensions. <br><br>
Here are the top 3 reasons Python is a great place to start and take your coding journey to heights. <br><br>
1. High demand for Python programmers <br>
2. Growing communities across the globe. <br>
3. Fastest growing programming language
